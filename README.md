# crochetica
side quest project<br>
start by clicking tutorials.html file as that's technically the homepage<br>
this was mostly made to test out my coding skills outside of course tutorials (though I still followed some for this project especially for javascript)<br>
I hope to make this a developed enough website so people can access crocheting resources more easily<br>
